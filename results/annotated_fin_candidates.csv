Its various actions are mediated by histamine receptors H1, H2, H3 and H4. This gene encodes one of the histamine receptors (H3) which belongs to the family 1 of G protein-coupled receptors. It is an integral membrane protein and can regulate neurotransmitter release. This receptor can also increase voltage-dependent calcium current in smooth muscles and innervates the blood vessels and the heart in cardiovascular system. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]."
